In the CPython implementation of Python, integer objects are cached (interned) for performance reasons. The range of integers that are cached can vary, but by default, CPython caches integers in the range of -5 to 256. Therefore, when `a = 1` is executed, Python will check if the integer `1` is already in the cache. Since it is, no new integer object is created for the value `1`.

Therefore, the execution of the first line of the script creates 0 new `int` objects since the integer `1` is already cached.
